# Basic Arithamatic operation
print(3 + 5) # operator to sum two number
print(6 - 8) # operator to difference two number
print(34 * 2) # operator to multilpy two number
print(45 / 8) # operator to division two number
print(4 % 6)  # operator to module(find reminder) two number
print(2 // 5) # for floor function applied
print(2 ** 4) # to make value as base and exponent

# some special function
print(bin(5)) #function to change value to binary number
print(int(1001)) #function to change value to integer number
print(round(4.4))# function to round off value
print(round(4.5))
print(round(4.6))
print(abs(45)) 

# variable = The name give to the location of the memory where different value an stored is called variable
#  for commenting (lines of code which compiler ignore) in python we use (#) symbol.
# variable (we dont have to describe datatype of variable ,variable by default itself make it as same as value)
