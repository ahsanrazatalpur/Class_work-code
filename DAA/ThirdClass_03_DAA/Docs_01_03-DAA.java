/*
 Modularity : to make seperate method for every function  or logic
 
 Static : Donot able to call non-static

 new Keyword is DMA(Dynamic memory allocation)

 two memory allocaation
 1. DMA(Dynamic memory allocation)  take memory in runtime  like new etc. 
 2. SMA(Static memory allocation)    take memoryin compile time

 SMA ->  primative (compile and decide memory)
 DMA -> non-primative (run and decide memory)

 int x = 5   <-- SMA
 int marks [] = new int[]  <-- DMA

 way to create object

 1. int [] arr = new int [5]   <- compile time
 2. int [] arr ; ( it is refrence variable)    <-- runtime 
 arr = new int[5] (it is object variable)    
 3.int arr = {}

 Object value stored in heap

 Array maybe continous or non continous in java

 refrence  stack but conttinous in c,c++
 array -> heap

 for each loop(collecton)
 for(int x :arr3)
 for(datatype variable : collecttion)
