i + = 2   mean here 2 (right side assign to left side)
i = i + 2   its also same  mean 2 assighn to i and i == new i 


These all are same all mean assign 1 to i
i ++;
i = i + 1;
i + = 1;

Foo loop
for(int i=0; i<20; 1++){
    sop(i);

    here first we check the value of i              first step,
    then we check is our number setisfy condition   Secound number,
    and then we just print that number              third step
    and then finaaly incarese number and reapeat all 
    step                                            final step
    
    1)after incraement we assign value to variable          reapeat 1st step
    2)and then is our number satisfy codittion ex. n<20     2nd step repeat
    3)and then print                                        3rd step repeat
    4)and again increase number and loop the step

    step are loop
    1 step (Assign value (strating))
    2 step (check condition)
    3 step (print that number)
    4 step (incrase number) 

   these step repeat until loop end (Note : 1 step aterate one time only)
    1  2  3  4  2  3   4   2  3  4



prefix ++i  (first incraee if have only one step and then print)
postfix i++ (first print if more than one step hapening and then print )
